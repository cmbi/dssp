# Development

The provided Dockerfile sets up a development environment. Build the docker
image using the command `docker build -t dssp .` and run the image in a
container, with a local source copy and data files mounted, with the command
`docker run -v /home/jon/projects/dssp:/app -v /mnt/extra:/srv/data -it dssp`.

# Download and installation instructions

Pre-compiled *old* versions of DSSP are available from the
[old repository][1]. New source code archives are available [here][2].

## Compiling dssp programs

### Pre-requisites

Compiler:
* Must support at least the c++ 11 standard.

System libraries:

* libboost version >= 1.48
* libz
* libbz2
* autoconf
* automake
* autotools-dev

### Instructions to build in Docker

This requires docker >= 1.12.3 and docker-compose >= 1.8.1.

From the repository, run:

    docker-compose build

Then, to run mkdssp:

    docker-compose run dssp ./mkdssp

### Instructions for installing mkdssp locally

From inside this repository, configure and build the dssp executables:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

To build only one executable of the dssp project, e.g. `mkdssp`, type:

    make mkdssp

To test the `mkdssp` executable type:

    ./mkdssp

To add the executables to /usr/local/bin type:

    sudo make install

# Contact

In 2013, maintenance of dssp has been taken over from Maarten Hekkelman by
Coos Baakman, Jon Black, and Wouter Touw. If you want to provide feedback,
either send an e-mail to dssp.cmbi@radboudumc.nl or have a look at
[existing issues][5] (if necessary, create a new issue).
